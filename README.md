## Who? | ᚹᚻᛟ?

For anyone

## What? | ᚹᚻᚨᛏ?

A script that reads standard string input and outputs elder futhark runes

> Note that because elder futhark doesn't have representative characters for `Q` or `Z`, those characters will pass through the script unaltered. As will special characters, numbers, and punctuation `123456789<>!@#$%^&*(),./\|~_`

## When? | ᚹᚻᛖᚾ?

ALWAYS, pipe everything into runes.sh

## Where? | ᚹᚻᛖᚱᛖ?

In terminal emulators near you, as long as they support UTF-8

## Why? | ᚹᚻᛃ?


Because its freakin awesome!
